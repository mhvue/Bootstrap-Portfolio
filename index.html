                    <p>Hi! or Nyob Zoo as I say in Hmong.  You can call me Mai (pronounced like 'my'). I went to school at UW Madison 
                      and graduated with a Zoology degree. Most people say I must love animals. Well, actully you can do so much more with the Zoology degree. I initially
                      wanted to work in a lab and study cancer. Well, by my junior year, I was like, "What the heck am I
                      doing?!" So then I started to have interest in the public health and somehow ended up in the Medicaid
                      insurance company doing community health. I love this because I work with low income folks and help them get
                      assistance with healthcare and community resources.
                  </p>
          
                  <br>
                  <p>Okay enough about work and school. Let's focus on the fun stuff! I like to watch comedy movies. I like Chuck
                      Norris jokes. I am almost the middle child? I say that with a question mark because in total, my siblings
                      and I equals 8. Yes, a big family but a wonderful family! We all moved to different parts of WI after
                      finishing college. I wanted to own my own bakery when I was little. Funny thing is, I'm not a good baker! My little
                      sister is actually very good at baking and decorating. I did work at a bakery for almost a year
                      and they taught me how to decorate, which I loved. It's so much fun. It's actually my hidden talent!</p>
